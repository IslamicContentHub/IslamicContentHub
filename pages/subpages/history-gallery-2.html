            <h2 id="section-title">The Semites</h2>
            <p>
                The term "Semites" refers to a group of nations historically believed to descend from Shem, the son of Noah. 
                This includes Babylonians, Assyrians, Hebrews, Phoenicians, Aramæans, Abyssinians, Sabæans, and Arabs. 
                Despite the term’s loose ethnological basis, it is widely used to describe these interrelated peoples.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the origin of the Semitic race remains uncertain, their languages and cultures have deeply influenced 
                the world. Semitic languages include Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic, with Arabic emerging as a 
                significant unifying element of their legacy.

        <section id="arabs-representatives">
            <h2 id="section-title">Arabs as Representatives of the Semitic Race</h2>
            <p>
                Arabic is considered the closest to the original Semitic language, or 'Ursemitisch.' The Arabs, due to their 
                geographical location and desert lifestyle, have preserved their Semitic heritage more purely than others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the rise of Islam (700 A.D.), the Arabs have expanded their language, religion, and culture across 
                vast regions, leaving a lasting legacy. While no longer a dominant temporal power, their spiritual and cultural 
                influence remains significant, particularly through Islam.

            <h2 id="section-title">Arabs of the North and South</h2>
            <p>
                Arabia was historically divided into North and South. The northern Bedouins lived as nomads in the desert, 
                while the southern peoples, such as the Sabæans, developed advanced civilizations with wealth and trade. 
                Their cultural and linguistic differences shaped the diverse Arab identity seen today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Northern Arabs spoke classical Arabic, the language of Pre-Islamic poetry and the Quran, while the southern 
                Arabs used the Himyarite dialect, distinct in script and language.
            </p>

        <section id="arab-genealogy">
            <h2 id="section-title">Arab Genealogy</h2>
            <p>
                Arabs trace their ancestry to two main lineages: the Adnani Arabs, descending from Isma'il (Ishmael), and 
                the Qahtani Arabs, descending from Qahtan (Joktan). The former is associated with the northern tribes, 
                while the latter includes southern groups like the Sabæans.
            </p>
            <p>
                The genealogical lineage of Arabs was preserved through oral traditions, with key figures like Isma'il playing 
                a central role in Islamic history and culture. The intermingling of northern and southern tribes further unified 
                Arab identity under Islam.
            </p>

        <section id="arabs-historical-context">
            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>
                The Arabs have played a significant role in shaping world history, particularly during the rise of Islam in the 7th century. Prior to Islam, Arab society was largely tribal, with each clan having its own customs, leaders, and traditions. However, the revelation of Islam to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) brought about a unifying force that transformed the Arabian Peninsula into a powerful and cohesive civilization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under the banner of Islam, the Arabs rapidly expanded their influence beyond the Arabian Peninsula. By the 8th century, Arab armies and merchants had established a vast empire that stretched from Spain in the west to the Indus River in the east. This empire, often referred to as the Islamic Caliphate, became a melting pot of cultures, uniting diverse peoples under the shared values of Islam.
            </p>
            <h2 id="islamic-golden-age">The Islamic Golden Age</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most remarkable periods in Arab history occurred between the 8th and 13th centuries, known as the Islamic Golden Age. During this time:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Knowledge Flourished: </strong>Arab scholars translated Greek, Persian, and Indian works into Arabic, preserving and enhancing knowledge that might otherwise have been lost.</li>
                    <li><strong>Centers of Learning: </strong>Cities like Baghdad, Damascus, and Cordoba became hubs of intellectual activity, hosting libraries, universities, and observatories.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scientific Contributions:  </strong>Innovations in mathematics (algebra), astronomy (accurate star charts), medicine (surgical tools), and chemistry laid the groundwork for modern science.</li>
                </ul>
