            <h2>The Life Of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ</h2>
            <p>
                Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), born in 570 A.D. in Mecca, belonged to the noble Quraysh tribe and the respected clan of Banu Hashim. His father, Abdullah, passed away before his birth, and his mother, Amina, passed away when he was six. Orphaned at a young age, he was cared for by his grandfather, Abdul Muttalib, and later by his uncle, Abu Talib, who became his guardian and supporter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Known as Al-Ameen (the Trustworthy) and As-Sadiq (the Truthful), Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) gained immense respect for his character. At the age of 25, he married Khadijah (RA), a noble and successful businesswoman. Their union brought comfort and support, and Khadijah (RA) became his first follower and the mother of his children.

            <h2>The Beginning of Revelation</h2>
            <p>
                At the age of 40, while meditating in the Cave of Hira, Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) received his first revelation through Angel Jibreel (Gabriel). The words of Allah, revealed over 23 years, were later compiled into the Qur’an. He was commanded to call people to worship Allah alone and to reject idolatry.

            <h2>Early Struggles in Mecca</h2>
            <p>
                Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) began his mission by inviting his close family and friends to Islam. Despite gaining a few followers, the Quraysh vehemently opposed him. He faced hostility, ridicule, and persecution, but his unwavering patience and compassion drew more people to the faith. His message emphasized the oneness of Allah (Tawheed), the importance of justice, and the need for compassion towards the weak and oppressed.

            <h2>The Migration to Medina (Hijra)</h2>
            <p>
                In 622 A.D., due to increasing persecution in Mecca, Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and his followers migrated to Medina. This event, known as the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. In Medina, he established the first Islamic state, uniting tribes through a social contract known as the Constitution of Medina.

            <h2>Triumph in Arabia</h2>
            <p>
                From Medina, the message of Islam spread rapidly. Key battles, such as Badr, Uhud, and Khandaq, tested the resilience of the Muslim community but ultimately solidified their position. In 630 A.D., Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) peacefully conquered Mecca, forgiving his former enemies and cleansing the Kaaba of idols.

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) passed away in 632 A.D. in Medina, leaving behind a profound legacy. Through his teachings and leadership, he transformed a divided and often chaotic society into one bound by faith, justice, and compassion. His life remains a timeless example of humility, wisdom, and mercy.
